Federated Learning Server Implementation

This module implements the server-side component for federated learning using
the Flower framework. The server coordinates the federated learning process
by managing client communications, aggregating model parameters, and orchestrating
the overall training workflow.

The server acts as the central coordinator in federated learning by:
1. Managing client connections and communications
2. Orchestrating federated learning rounds
3. Aggregating client model updates using federated averaging (FedAvg)
4. Broadcasting updated global model to participating clients
5. Monitoring training progress and convergence

Key Responsibilities:
- Client management: Handle client connections and disconnections
- Round coordination: Orchestrate FL training rounds across clients
- Parameter aggregation: Combine local model updates into global model
- Model broadcasting: Distribute updated global model to clients
- Progress monitoring: Track training metrics and convergence

This implementation uses Flower's built-in server capabilities to provide
robust federated learning coordination with minimal custom logic required.
The server can handle client failures, variable participation, and provides
extensible hooks for custom aggregation strategies.

    Initialize and start the federated learning server.
    
    This function sets up and starts a Flower federated learning server that
    coordinates training across multiple distributed clients. The server
    implements the standard FedAvg (Federated Averaging) algorithm by default.
    
    Why a dedicated server:
    - Centralized coordination: Manages distributed training process
    - Parameter aggregation: Combines client updates using FedAvg algorithm
    - Client synchronization: Ensures all clients train on same global model
    - Fault tolerance: Handles client failures and network issues
    - Scalability: Can coordinate large numbers of federated clients
    
    How the server works:
    1. Initialize server with specified configuration
    2. Listen for incoming client connections
    3. For each FL round:
       a. Select participating clients (all clients in this case)
       b. Send current global model to selected clients
       c. Wait for clients to complete local training
       d. Aggregate received model updates using FedAvg
       e. Update global model with aggregated parameters
    4. Repeat until specified number of rounds completed
    
    Server Configuration:
    - num_rounds: Number of federated learning rounds to execute
    - server_address: Network address and port for client connections
    - Default aggregation: FedAvg (Federated Averaging) algorithm
    
    Use in federated learning simulation:
    - Coordinates distributed training across multiple clients
    - Ensures consistent global model state across all participants
    - Provides centralized logging and monitoring of FL progress
    - Enables scalable federated learning deployments
    
    Note: This server implementation is designed for research and simulation.
    Production deployments may require additional security, authentication,
    and fault tolerance mechanisms.
